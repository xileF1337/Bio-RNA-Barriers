Bio-RNA-Barriers

This module provides auxiliary classes to parse, query, manipulate and print
the files generated by Barriers, a tool to compute RNA energy landscapes
and folding kinetics developed at Theoretical Biochemistry Group (TBI) at the
University of Vienna. Note that this module is not written and maintained
by the authors of Barriers.

Supports the result file (written to STDOUT by Barriers) as well as rate
matrices in binary and text format. Properties like the number of minima or,
for each minima, their fathers and children, connectedness, and basin sizes
can be queried.

Rate matrices can be manipulated easily, e. g. to remove or keep certain
states or to convert between binary and text representation.
