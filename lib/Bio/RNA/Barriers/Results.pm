=head1 NAME

Bio::RNA::Barriers::Results - Parse, query and manipulate results
of a I<Barriers> run

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bio::RNA::Barriers;

    # Read in a Barriers output file.
    open my $barriers_handle, '<', $barriers_file;
    my $bardat = Bio::RNA::Barriers::Results->new($barriers_handle);
    # Or, even simpler, pass file name directly:
    $bardat    = Bio::RNA::Barriers::Results->new($barriers_file  );

    # Print some info
    print "There are ", $bardat->min_count, " minima.";
    my $min3 = $bardat->get_min(3);
    print $min3->grad_struct_count,
          " structures lead to basin 3 via a gradient walk.\n"
        if $min3->has_bsize;
    print "Min ", $min3->index, " is ", ($min3->is_connected ? "" : "NOT"),
          " connected to the mfe structure.\n";

    # Print the mfe basin line as in the results file
    my $mfe_min = $bardat->get_global_min();
    print "$mfe_min\n";


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is what you usually want to use. Pass a file name or a handle to the
constructor and you're golden. When querying a specific minimum by index, a
L<Bio::RNA::Barriers::Minimum> object is returned. For more details on its
methods, please refer to its documentation.

=head1 METHODS

=head3 Bio::RNA::Barriers::Results->new()

Constructs the results object from a Barriers results file.

=over 4

=item Supported argument list types:

=over 4

=item new($barriers_file_path):

Open handle and read data from the passed path, set file name accordingly.

=item new($barriers_handle):

A file handle to read data from, C<file_name()> will return
undef.

=item new($barriers_handle, $barriers_file_path):

Read data from handle and set file name from a given path.

=item new($hash_ref):

Manual construction from required attributes. Only for experts.

=back

=back

=head3 $res->seq()

Returns the RNA sequence for which the minima have been computed.

=head3 $res->file_name()

Name of the file from which the minima have been read. May be C<undef>.

=head3 $res->mins()

Returns a list of all minima. Useful for iteration in C<for> loops.

=head3 $res->get_min($index)

Return the single minimum given by a 1-based C<$index> (as used in the results
file).

=head3 $res->get_mins(@indices)

Return a list of minima given by a 1-based list of C<@indices> (as used in the
results file).

=head3 $res->get_global_min()

Returns the basin represented by the (global) mfe structure (i.e. basin 1).

=head3 $res->mfe()

Get the global minimum free energy.

=head3 $res->delta_energy()

Get the delta_E of the landscape, i. e. the energy difference between the
(global) minimum free energy and and the highest energy encountered.

=head3 $res->max_energy()

Get the maximum energy of any structure in the landscape.

=head3 $res->min_count()

Returns the total number of basins.

=head3 $res->connected_mins()

Returns a list of all minima connected to the mfe minimum (min 1).

=head3 $res->connected_indices()

Returns a list of indices of all connected minima (cf. C<connected_mins()>).

=head3 $res->keep_connected()

Keep only connected minima and remove all others. The indices are remapped to
1..k for k kept minima.  Returns (old) indices of all kept minima.

=head3 $res->update_connected(@connected_mins)

Given an ordered list of indices of all connected minima (as returned by
C<RateMatrix::keep_connected()>), delete all other minima and update their
ancesters' basin size information accordingly.

=head3 $res->keep_first_mins($min_count)

Keep only the first C<$min_count> mins. (If there are only that many or less
minima in total, do nothing.)

WARNING: THIS CAN DISCONNECT THE LANDSCAPE! The bar file will still look
connected, however, modifying the rate matrix accordingly can lead to
non-ergodicity (e.g. when basin 3 merged to 2, 2/3 merged to 1 because
of a possible transition from 3 to 1, and basin 3 is then removed).  Returns a
list of all removed mins (may be empty).

=head3 $res->has_bsize()

Check whether the stored minima contain information about the basin sizes as
computed by Barriers' --bsize switch. Checks only the mfe basin (since all or
neither min should have this information).

=head3 $res->path()

Construct the file path to this Barriers file. Works only if it was actually
parsed from a file (of course...).  Returns the path as a string.

=head3 $res->stringify()

Convert back to Barriers file. Also supports stringification overloading, i.
e. C<"$res"> is equivalent to C<$res-E<gt>stringify()>.
