=head1 DESCRIPTION

Parse, modify and print/write rate matrix files written by I<Barriers>, both
in text and binary format.

=head1 METHODS

=head3 Bio::RNA::Barriers::RateMatrix->new(arg_name => $arg, ...)

Constructor. Reads a rate matrix from a file / handle and creates a new rate
matrix object.

=over 4

=item Arguments:

=over 4

=item file_name | file_handle

Source of the data to read. Pass either or both.

=item file_type

Specifies whether the input data is in binary or text format. Must be either
C<'TXT'> or C<'BIN'>.

=item splice_on_parsing (optional)

Array ref of integers denoting states for which the transition rates should be
parsed. All other states are skipped. This dramatically improves the
performance and memory efficiency for large matrices if only a few states are
relevant (e.g. only connected states).

=back

=back

=head3 $mat->file_name()

File from which the data was read. May be undef if it was read from a file
handle.

=head3 $mat->file_type()

Specifies whether the input data is in binary or text format. Must be either
C<'TXT'> or C<'BIN'>.

=head3 Bio::RNA::RateMatrix->read_text_rate_matrix($input_matrix_filehandle)

Class method. Reads a rate matrix in text format from the passed file
handle and constructs a matrix (2-dim array) from it. Returns an array
reference containing the parsed rate matrix.

Use this function if you do not want to use the object-oriented interface.

=head3 Bio::RNA::RateMatrix->read_bin_rate_matrix($input_matrix_filehandle)

Class method. Reads a rate matrix in binary format from the passed file
handle and constructs a matrix (2-dim array) from it. Returns an array
reference containing the parsed rate matrix.

Use this function if you do not want to use the object-oriented interface.

=head3 $mat->dim()

Get the dimension (= number of rows = number of columns) of the matrix.

=head3 $mat->rate_from_to($i, $j)

Get the rate from state i to state j. States are 1-based (first state = state
1) just as in the results file.

=head3 $mat->remove_states(@indices)

Remove the passed states from this rate matrix. States are 1-based (first
state = state 1) just as in the results file.

=head3 $mat->connected_states()

Returns a sorted list of all states connected to the (mfe) state 1.
Assumes a symmetric transition matrix (only checks path B<from> state 1
B<to> the other states). Quadratic runtime.

=head3 $mat->keep_connected()

Only keep the states connected to the mfe (as determined by
C<connected_states()>).

=head3 $mat->keep_states(@indices)

Remove all but the passed states from this rate matrix. States are 1-based
(first state = state 1) just as in the results file. C<@indices> may be
unordered and contain duplicates.

=head3 $mat->splice(@indices)

Only keep the passed states and reorder them to match the order of
C<@indices>. In particular, the same state can be passed multiple times and
will then be deep-copied. C<@indices> may be unordered and contain duplicates.

=head3 $mat->print_as_text($out_handle)
